# The Old Man and the Sea 2/30
《老人与海》海明威
# 正文
**When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory;but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.**

*当遇到东风的时候，在这里能闻到鲨鱼工厂穿过港口过来的气味，但今天只闻到一点模糊的味道，因为刮的是北风而且逐渐平息了，阳光照在露天酒吧，让人愉快。*

**"Santiago," The boy said.<br/>
"Yes," the old man said.He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.<br/>
"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?"<br/>
"No.Go and play baseball.I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net."<br/>
"I would like to go.If I cannot fish with you.I would like to serve in some way."<br/>
"You bought me a beer,"the old man said."You are already a man."<br/>
"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?"<br/>
"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?"<br/>
"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the seeet blood smell all over me."<br/>
"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?"<br/>
"I remember everything from whenwe first went together."<br/>**

*"桑迪亚哥"男孩说<br/>
"啊"老人回应道，他握着玻璃杯，想着很久以前的事情。<br/>
"我能去帮你准备明天用的沙丁鱼吗?"<br/>
"不，去玩足球把，我能划船，Rogelio 会扔网"<br/>
"我很想去，如果我不能和你一起去捕鱼，我想帮你做些事情。"<br/>
"你请我喝了啤酒"老人说"你已经是个男人了"<br/>
"你还记得你第一次带我上船的时候我多大吗?"<br/>
"五岁，你差点死了，我过早把鱼拉上来，它差点把船撕成碎片，你还记得吗?"<br/>
"我记得鱼尾用力的拍，撞，还有你用棍子敲打它的声音，你将我扔到船的角落里，那里有盘绕的绳子，我感觉到船要散开了，只听到你用力敲打鱼的声音就像砍树一样，我浑身都是甜甜的血腥味。"<br/>
"你是真的记得还是我告诉你之后你才想起来?"<br/>
"我记得从你第一次带我上船的每一件事"<br/>*

**The Old man looked at him with his sun-burned,confident loving eyes.<br/>
"If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble,"he said."But you are your father's and you mother's and you are in a lucky boat."<br/>
"May I get the sardines?I know where I can get four baits too."<br/>
"I have mine left from today.I put them in salt in the box."<br/>
"Let me get four fresh ones."<br/>
"One," the old man said.His hope and his confidence had never gone.But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises.<br/>
"Two,"the boy said.<br/>
"Two,"the old man agreed."You didn't steal them?"<br/>
"I would," the boy said."But I bought these."<br/>
"Thank you,"the old man said.He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility.But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.<br/>
"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said.<br/>
"where are you going?"the boy asked.<br/>
"Far out to come in when the wind shifts.I want to be out before it is light."<br/>
"I'll try to get him to work far out,"the boy said."Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid."<br/>
"He does not like to work too far out."<br/>
"No,"the boy said."But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin."<br/>
"Are his eyes that bad?"<br/>
"He is almost blind."<br/>
"It is strange,"the old man said."He never went turtle-ing.That is what kills the eyes."<br/>
"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good."<br/>
"I am a strange old man"<br/>
"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?"<br/>
"I think so.And there are many tricks."<br/>
"Let us take the stuff home,"the boy said."So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines."<br/>**

*老人用他那被太阳照晒，充满信心与爱怜的眼睛望着他。<br/>
"如果你是我的孩子，我将带你出去赌一把。"他说"但你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，而且你现在跟着一条幸运的船。"<br/>
"或许我可以去弄一些沙丁鱼？我还知道哪里可以弄到四个鱼饵呢。"<br/>
"今天我还剩下一些，我把他们放到盒子里用盐腌起来了。"<br/>
"还是让我弄四个新鲜的吧"<br/>
"一个就够了"老人说，他的希望和他的信心从没有消逝，而且又有了新的动力，就像微风冉冉升起。<br/>
"两个"男孩说<br/>
"两个就两个吧"老人同意了"你不会是去偷吧"<br/>
"我可能会"男孩说"但这两个我准备买"<br/>
"谢谢你"老人说。他太单纯以至于他不知道什么时候变得谦逊，他变得谦逊，而且他知道谦逊并不可耻，而且谦逊不会让他失去真正的骄傲。<br/>
"从当前情况看明天将是一个好天气"他说<br/>
"你准备去哪儿呢?"男孩问<br/>
"去远一点，在风转向的时候就回来，天亮之前就出发。"<br/>
"我会努力让他也开远点"男孩说"这样的话如果你钓了大鱼，我们能赶过去帮忙"<br/>
"他一直不喜欢在太远的地方钓鱼"<br/>
"是的"男孩说"但是我能看到一些他看不到的东西，比如鸟在捕鱼和让他跟在海豚后面"<br/>
"他的视力有那么差吗?"<br/>
"他几乎要瞎了"<br/>
"很奇怪"老人说"他从没有捕捉过海龟，那才是真正的伤害视力"<br/>
"你以前在蚊子海岸捕捉过好几年海龟，你的视力还是很好"<br/>
"我是一个奇怪的老头子"<br/>
"你现在还有足够的力气去钓一条大鱼吗"<br/>
"我想应该可以，我有很多技巧"<br/>
"让我们带这些东西回家吧"男孩说"然后我去拿网去捉沙丁鱼"<br/>*

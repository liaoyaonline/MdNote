《老人与海》海明威
# 正文
**They picked up the gear from the boat.The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled,hard-braided brown lines,the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft.The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used tosubdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.No one would steal from the old man but it was beter to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.**<br/>
*他们从船上拿起打渔的工具，老人将桅杆扛在肩膀上，男孩则抱着木箱子，里面有盘在一起，结实的棕色绳子，鱼钩和鱼叉。这个箱子和毒饵还有木棒一起放在船尾，木棒是用来对付被拖上船的大鱼的。没人会从老人这偷东西，但还是应该把帆和绳索拿回家，因为露水对这些东西而言是有害的。尽管他确信没有本地人会偷他的东西，但老人认为把鱼钩和鱼叉放到船上是一种没必要的诱惑。*<br/>
**They walked up the road together to the oldman's shack and went in through its open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack.The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed,a table,one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal.On the brown walls of the flattened,overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre.**<br/>
*他们穿过小路一起走到老人的窝棚那里，老人将桅杆靠在墙上，把团成一团的帆布堆在下边，男孩把手上的箱子和其他东西放到桅杆旁边。这个桅杆很长和一个房间长度一样长。这个窝棚是用本地的棕榈树做成的，里面只有一张床，一张桌子，一个椅子和一个挖在泥地上的灶，里面有些木炭。墙是用棕榈页压扁堆叠成的，上面挂了一张耶稣圣心像，一张考伯圣女像。*<br/>
**These were relics of his wife.Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.**<br/>
*这是他妻子的遗物，过去那里还有一张他妻子的彩色照片，后来他因为每次看到它都过于伤心就把它取下来放到一边用他的干净的衬衫盖起来。*<br/>
**"what do you have to eat?"the boy asked.<br/>
"A pot of yellow rice with fish.Do you want some?"<br/>
"No.I will eat at home.Do you want me to make the fire?"<br/>
"No.I will make it later on.Or I may eat the rice cold."<br/>
"May I take the cast net?"<br/>
"Of course"<br/>**
*"你还有什么吃的吗？"男孩问<br/>
"一点黄米饭和鱼，你要吃一点吗?"<br/>
"不，我要回家吃，你要我去生火吗?"<br/>
"不，我等会儿会去生火的，或者我直接吃冷的算了"<br/>
"那我可以拿这个渔网吗？"<br/>
"当然可以"*<br/>
**There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day.There was no pot of yellow rice and fisth and the boy knew this too.**<br/>
*这里是没有渔网男孩早就知道，他们已经把渔网卖掉了。但他们还是每天这样表演一下。男孩同样知道这里也没有黄米饭和鱼。*<br/>
**"Eighty-five is a lucky number,"the old man said."How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?"<br/>
"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines.Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?"
"Yes.I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball."<br/>
They boy did not know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too.But the old man brought it out from under the bed.<br/>
"Perico gave it to me at the bodega,"he explained.<br/>
"I'll be back when I have the sardines.I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.then I come back you can tell me about the baseball."<br/>
"The Yankees cannot lose."<br/>
"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland."<br/>
"Have faith in the Yankees my son.Think of the great DiMaggio."<br/>
"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland"<br/>
"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago."<br/>
"You study it and tell me when I come back"<br/>
"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five?Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day."<br/>
"We can do that,"the boy said."But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?"<br/>
"It could not happen twice.Do you think you can find an eighty-five?"<br/>
"I can order one."<br/>
"It could not happen twice.Do you think you can find  an eighty-five?"<br/>
"I can order one."<br/>
"One sheet.That's two dollars and a half.Who can we borrow that from?"<br/>
"That's easy.I can always borrow two dollars and a half"<br/>
"I think perhaps I can too.But I try not to borrow.First you borrow.Then you beg."<br/>
"Keep warm old man,"the boy said."Remember we are in September."<br/>
"The month when the great fish come,"the old man said."Anyone can be a fisherman in May"<br/>
"I go now for the sardines,"the boy said.**<br/>
*"85是个幸运的数字"老人说"你想不想看到我带一条超过一千磅的鱼回来?"<br/>
"我去拿网捕沙丁鱼去了，你坐在门口晒一下太阳吧"<br/>
"好的，我有一份今天的报纸，正好看看棒球报道"<br/>
男孩不知道这个报纸是不是虚构的，但是老人从床底下拿出了一份报纸<br/>
"皮特在酒窖给我的"老人解释到<br/>
"我弄到沙丁鱼就回来，我会将你的和我的一起冰起来明天早上用，等我回来你告诉棒球赛的消息。"<br/>
"洋基队不会输"<br/>
"我担心克利夫兰的印第安队"<br/>
"不要对洋基队失去信心，我的孩子，想想伟大的迪马乔"<br/>
"我担心克利夫兰的印第安队和底特律的老虎队"<br/>
"再担心下去，你恐怕会担心辛辛那提的红人队和芝加哥的白袜队"<br/>
"你研究吧，等回来告诉我结果"<br/>
"你觉得我们应该买一张85为尾数的彩票吗，明天就是我没捕到鱼的第85天"<br/>
"可以那样做"男孩说，"87才是你的记录"<br/>
"它不可能发生发生两次，你能订到一张85的彩票吗"<br/>
"我可以订到一张"<br/>
"一张就是2.5美元，我从哪里去得到2.5美元呢"<br/>
"这倒是很简单，我随便都能借到2.5美元"<br/>
"我认为我也能借到，但我不会那么去做，刚开始你去借，接下来就该去乞讨了。"<br/>
"别受冷了"男孩说"现在已经九月了"<br/>
"这个月份正是大鱼来的月份"老人说"任何人能在五月成为渔夫"<br/>
"我抓沙丁鱼去了"男孩说*<br/>
**when the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down.The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and owver the old man's shoulders.They were strange shoulders,still powerful although very old ,and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward.His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the atches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
The old man's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face.The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze.He was barefooted.**<br/>
*当男孩回来的时候，老人已经躺在椅子上睡着了，太阳已经落下了。男孩将一个军毯从床上拿过来盖在老人身上。老人即使已经很老了，他的肩膀依然强壮，他的颈部也很结实，即使睡着了，他的头往下坠，皱纹也没显示很多。他的衬衫和帆布一样打了很多补丁，随着时间的流逝，补丁褪色成深浅不一的颜色。老人的头部显得老，眼睛紧闭，就像已经失去生命。报纸在膝盖上，他的胳膊挂在两边，在晚风的吹拂下摆动，老人赤着脚。*<br/>
